## About myself:
More than 2 years ago I have started my career as a system analyst in software development projects. Sometimes my responsibilities have been including UX/UI-design steps, thats why I have good knowledge of design tools. 
Working on software development projects I've bacame to understand main steps of developing sytems, to get skills of analizing users and technical requirments, to work independentely or as a member of different IT teams.
Currently I'm actively studying basics of Frontend development. I believe these knowledges will share my mind and give me chance to understand developers better.
